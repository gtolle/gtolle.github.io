I'm the co-founder of
[Share Some Style](http://www.sharesomestyle.com), along with [Diane Loviglio](http://www.dianeloviglio.com).

If you're feeling fashion-challenged and want help, we're the easiest
and most affordable way to get 1-on-1 help from a style expert.

Your personal stylist will come to your house, teach you how to create
real outfits from the clothes you already have, take you out shopping
for great new stuff, shop for you online whenever you want, give you
feedback on the outfits you put together yourself, and get you all sorted out.

Beats the heck out of getting a box of clothes in the mail!

Plus, you'll have lots of fun. 

In my spare time, I love:

* running
* reading mind-bending and hilarious books
* teaching people to code
* geeking out around data visualization for stuff like transit and biking and finances

I'm starting this blog to post random things - probably more tech and teaching-oriented, but we'll see.
