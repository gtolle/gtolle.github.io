I'm the co-founder of
[Share Some Style](http://www.sharesomestyle.com), along with Diane Loviglio.

If you're feeling fashion-challenged and want help, we're the easiest
and most affordable way to get 1-on-1 help from a style
expert. Your personal stylist will come to your house, take you out shopping, shop for
you online, and get you all sorted out.

Beats the heck out of getting a box of clothes in the mail! Plus, you'll have lots of fun.

In my spare time, I love:

* running
* reading mind-bending and hilarious books
* teaching people to code
* geeking out around data visualization for stuff like transit and biking and finances

I'm starting this blog to post random things - probably more tech-slanted and teaching-oriented, but we'll see.
